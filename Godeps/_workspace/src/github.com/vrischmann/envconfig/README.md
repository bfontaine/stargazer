envconfig is a library which allows you to parse your configuration from environment variables and fill an arbitrary struct.

See [the example](https://godoc.org/github.com/vrischmann/envconfig#example-Init) to understand how to use it, it's pretty simple.

Supported types
---------------

  * Almost all standard types plus `time.Duration` are supported by default.
  * Slices and arrays
  * Arbitrary structs
  * Custom types via the [Unmarshaler](https://godoc.org/github.com/vrischmann/envconfig/#Unmarshaler) interface.

How does it work
----------------

*envconfig* takes the hierarchy of your configuration struct and the names of the fields to create a environment variable key.

For example:

    var conf struct {
        Name string
        Shard struct {
            Host string
            Port int
        }
    }

This will check for those 3 keys:

  * NAME
  * SHARD\_HOST
  * SHARD\_PORT

With slices or arrays, the same naming is applied for the slice. To put multiple elements into the slice or array, you need to separate
them with a *,* (will probably be configurable in the future, or at least have a way to escape)

For example:

    var conf struct {
        Ports []int
    }

This will check for the key __PORTS__:

  * if your variable is *9000* the slice will contain only 9000
  * if your variable is *9000,100* the slice will contain 9000 and 100

For slices of structs, it's a little more complicated. The same splitting of slice elements is done with a *,* however, each token must follow
a specific format like this: *{<first field>,<second field>,...}*

For example:

    var conf struct {
        Shards []struct {
            Name string
            Port int
        }
    }

This will check for the key __SHARDS__. Example variable content: `{foobar,9000},{barbaz,20000}`

This will result in two struct defined in the *Shards* slice.

Future work
-----------

  * support for defaut values ? don't know how to yet
  * support for time.Time values with a layout defined via a field tag
  * support for complex types
